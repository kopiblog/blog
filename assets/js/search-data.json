            "content": "Aim . A projectile is launched with velocity $v_0$ at an angle θ to the horizontal. We want to investigate and analyze its trajectory and study the effect of changing the launch angle θ. We illustrate it visually for a clearer understanding. . 1. Maximum Height . For finding maximum height $h$ reached by the projectile, we consider motion in vertical direction i.e. along y-axis. . initial velocity = $v_0sinθ$ final velocity = $0$ acceleration = $-g$ . Using $ begin{align}v^2 - u^2 = 2as end{align}$ we get $ begin{align}0^2 - v_0^2sin^2θ = 2(-g)h end{align}$ $ begin{align}v_0^2sin^2θ = 2gh end{align}$ . i.e. . $ begin{align} Large h = frac{v_0^2sin^2θ}{2g} end{align}$ . 2. Time of Flight . For finding maximum height $h$, we again consider motion in vertical direction. . initial velocity = $v_0sinθ$ displacement = $0$ acceleration = $-g$ . Using $ begin{align}s = ut + frac{1}{2} at^2 end{align}$ we get $ begin{align}0 = v_0tsinθ - frac{1}{2}gt^2 end{align}$ $ begin{align}0 = t(v_0sinθ - frac{1}{2}gt) end{align}$ . This gives $ begin{align}t = 0 end{align}$ or $ begin{align}v_0sinθ - frac{1}{2}gt = 0 end{align}$ . Thus, the time of flight is as below :- . $ begin{align} Large t = frac{2v_0sinθ}{g} end{align}$ . 3. Range . For finding the range $s$ or the distance where the projectile lands on the ground, we consider motion in horizontal direction i.e. along x-axis. . Initial Velocity = $v_0cosθ$ . Time of Flight = $ frac{2v_0sinθ}{g}$ (from section 2) . $ begin{align}s = ut end{align}$ . $ begin{align} = frac{(v_0cosθ)(2v_0sinθ)}{g} end{align}$ . $ begin{align} = frac{2v_0^2sinθcosθ}{g} end{align}$ . $ begin{align} = frac{v_0^2sin2θ}{g} end{align}$ . i.e. . $ Large s = frac{v_0^2sin2θ}{g}$ . 4. Visual Plots . Using the equations derived in sections 1, 2 and 3, we can compute the trajectory of the projectile and plot it. . Using time as the independent variable, we generate $x$ and $y$ and plot $y$ versus $x$ for a range of values of $ theta$ from $10^{ circ}$ to $90^{ circ}$. We use $g = 9.8 m/s^2$ and $v_0 = 100 m/s$ . 5. Animation of Trajectory . Finally, we animate the trajectory of the projectile for a certain value of $ theta = 45^{ circ}$. It is easy to change ${ theta}$ and run the animation for various other values of ${ theta}$ . Your browser does not support the video tag.",

            "content": "Circle . If a line is rotated about a point, any fixed point on the line traces out a circle. This is illustrated in the animation below where a green point and a red point on the blue stick are seen to trace out their circles when the stick completes a full rotation. . Your browser does not support the video tag. Spirals . But if a point is allowed to be moved outwards along the stick while the stick is being rotated, it traces out a spiral. . If the outward movement is directly proportional to the angle of rotation, we get a Linear spiral or Archimedean spiral (blue). In other words, the point&#39;s linear velocity along the stick is constant just like the angular velocity of the stick&#39;s rotation. In polar co-ordinates $$r = a theta$$ . If the linear velocity along the stick increases exponentially with the angle of rotation, we get a Logarithmic spiral (red). In polar co-ordinates $$ r = ae^{b theta}$$ .
